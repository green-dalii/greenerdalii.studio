                    As we've grown, we've seen how Preline has helped companies
                    such as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom
                    bring their designers closer together to create amazing
                    things. We've also learned that when the culture of sharing
                    is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and
                    communicate with one another.

                      To say that switching to Preline has been life-changing is

                      We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to
                      create an opportunity for everyone to try Preline and
                      explore how transformative open communication can be. Now
                      you can have a team of one or two designers and unlimited
                      spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share
                      work and explore the design process earlier.

                      Preline opened a new way of sharing. It's a persistent way
                      for everyone to see and absorb each other's work," said
                      David Scott, Creative Director at <a

                  <p class="text-lg">
                    Small teams and individual designers need a space where they
                    can watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and
                    for the people they work with â€“ no matter if it's a fellow
                    designer, product manager, developer or client. Preline
                    allows you to invite more people into the process, creating
                    a central place for conversation around design. As those
                    teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes
                    integrated in how they communicate and work together.
