description: "Diflowy [diflowy.greenerai.top]是一个充满活力的社区平台,致力于推动Dify.AI工作流的分享、发现、下载和托管服务。因为有用户反馈原品牌形象与其他企业存在”撞车“现象，所以委托我们进行品牌形象的重塑。针对Diflowy线上社区的应用场景，结合Dify.AI的生态关系，我们呼应Dify.AI使用蓝色作为品牌主色，并巧妙将品牌字母中的”D“与”F“进行融合，创造出具有Flow流动感的视觉语言，具有很强的视觉延展能力。"
enDescription: "Diflowy is a vibrant community platform dedicated to the sharing, discovery, downloading, and hosting of Dify.AI workflows. Based on user feedback indicating that the original brand image was similar to other companies, we were commissioned to rebrand the platform. For Diflowy's online community, aligned with Dify.AI's ecosystem, we adopted blue as the main brand color, echoing Dify.AI. We also ingeniously integrated the letters 「D」 and 「F」 in the brand logo, creating a dynamic visual language with strong visual impact."

Bringing the culture of sharing to everyone
We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an opportunity for everyone to try Preline and explore how transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of one osr two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process earlier.
